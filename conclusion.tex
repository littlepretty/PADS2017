\section{Conclusion and Future Works}

In this paper we showed that a SDN network can be reduced to a simple OpenFlow switch
without the loss of the forwarding logic defined by all the rules in the network.
We proposed a three-step solution to this abstraction problem.
First we slice all the possible packets in the network into equivalence classes.
Then we build forwarding graphs for each equivalence class.
By traversing forwarding graphs, we can generate new rules to be installed
on the big switch.
Experiment demonstrates that the big switch abstracted by our approach correctly models
the end-to-end forwarding behavior of the SDN network with tolerable computational overhead.
Simulation running time can be reduced using our big-switch model.
In the future, we plan to solve the problem of how to preserve the end-to-end latency
equivalence.
