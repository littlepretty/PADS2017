\subsection{SDN Forwarding Rules Abstraction}

The ``one big switch" concept was proposed in \cite{OneBigSwitchAbstraction} for a different purpose. In their work, the network abstraction is used to reduce conflicting rules generated by various high-level SDN applications, which often simultaneously run on one or even multiple controllers. Application developers only need to specify the end-to-end connectivity policies on the big switch, and the SDN infrastructure is responsible for hop-by-hop routing and rule placement mechanisms.
Our work applies the concept in a reversed direction for enhancing the scalability of network simulation and emulation. We collect the forwarding rules on each device and use the rules to correctly infer the end-to-end forwarding policies.
Our model abstraction approach is based on statically analyzing snapshots of the network state. There exists a line of research on network fault detection by analyzing software, configuration and network-wide data-plane state \cite{Al-Shaer2010,Al-Shaer2009,Anteater2011,xz+05}. Those approaches typically operate offline on timescales of seconds to hours. Real time network verification tools are developed to enforce correctness in connectivity \cite{NetPlumber2013,Veriflow}. Our work leverages the idea of slicing the entire network into equivalence classes in \cite{Veriflow} to reduce the problem space, which enables fast model abstraction execution speed.

%We consider the entire connected SDN network when we run forwarding traversal, especially the boundary switches that Veriflow neglects. We also add up several algorithms in finding equivalence classes.


\subsection{SDN Emulation and Simulation}
There are a number of SDN emulation and simulation testbeds based on the OpenFlow
protocol.
Examples include Mininet \cite{Mininet}, EstiNet \cite{Estinet}, ns-3 \cite{NS3},
S3FNet \cite{S3F_website}, fs-sdn \cite{FSSDN} and OpenNet \cite{OpenNet}.
Mininet  \cite{Mininet} applies container-based virtualization technique and cgroup based resource isolation to provide a lightweight and high fidelity emulation
platform.
Its functional fidelity is guaranteed by executing real SDN switch/controller software.
ns-3 \cite{NS3} offers simulation models of SDN networks and emulation of SDN controllers via the direct code execution (DCE) technique.
S3FNet \cite{S3F_website} is a hybrid OpenFlow-based SDN testing platform that integrates a parallel network simulator with an OpenVZ-based network emulator.
fs-sdn \cite{FSSDN} extends fs, a flow-level discrete event network simulator, with the SDN capability.
We develop a model abstraction method in this paper to transform a large scale and complicated SDN network to a one-big-switch-based network.
We can use the resulting abstracted network model in all the aforementioned simulation and emulation environment for performance gain while still preserving the network forwarding logic.
