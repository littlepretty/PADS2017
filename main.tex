% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

\begin{abstract}

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology promises centralized and rapid network provisioning,
holistic management, low operational cost, and improved network visibility.
Researchers have developed multiple SDN simulation and emulation platforms to expedite
the adoption of many emerging SDN-based applications to production systems.
However, the scalability of those platforms is often limited by the underlying physical
hardware resources, which inevitably affects the simulation fidelity in large-scale network settings.
In this paper, we present a model abstraction technique that effectively transforms
the network devices in an SDN-based network to one virtualized switch model.
While significantly enhancing the simulation scalability,
our abstracted model also preserves the end-to-end forwarding behavior of the original network.
To achieve this, we first classify packets with the same forwarding behavior into smaller
and disjoint groups by analyzing the OpenFlow rules installed on the SDN devices.
We then create a graph model for each group representing its forwarding behavior.
We traverse those graphs to aggregate the forwarding rules across the network,
and finally generate the effective rules for the big switch model.
Experimental results demonstrate that the network forwarding logic equivalence is well
preserved between the abstracted model and the original SDN network.
The model abstraction process is fast, e.g., 3.15 seconds to transform a medium-scale
tree network consisting of 53,260 rules.
The big-switch model is able to speed up the simulation by 4.3 times in average and
6.69 times in best case.


%Only one switch and 5766 forwarding rules are sufficient to model a tree-topology network with 40 switches and 53260 rules.

%Emulating the big-switch network has many benefits such as emulation resource reduction, larger-scale network support and component reuse.
%Our long term goal is to abstract the clustered portion of the SDN network so that
%emulating one OpenFlow switch is equivalent to a great number of interconnected
%OpenFlow switches in terms of both forwarding logics and network performance metrics.
